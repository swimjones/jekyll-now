Student loans are the de facto elephant in the room. The average student loan debt for a 2017 graduate was a stunning $39,400â€” an increase of <i><a href="https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/">six percent</a></i> compared to last year.

While being educated is never a disadvantage, there are certain risks and consequences that young people face in deciding whether or not to continue their education. With all the options available for self-education, it's worth knowing what you're getting yourself into should you choose to pursue traditional higher education.

## Student debt inhibits your ability to take risks.

They don't describe it as a ball-and-chain for nothing.

When you have a liability like a loan repayment, it is imperative that you do whatever it takes to cover the payment, even if it means keeping a job that you hate in a city you're tired of living in. Unless you have an alternate (and preferably location-independent) form of income, you will be unable to maneuver freely and will be locked into your scenario by your debt.

This is especially important for those interested in being entrepreneurs, as having a consistent liability like student debt will hamper your ability to take the financial risks necessary to grow a company.

## You cannot declare bankruptcy.

If you gamble yourself into oblivion, or take out a loan to buy a sports car, and realize you can't pay the lender back the money, you can file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and be cleared of your obligation. Of course, your credit score will be ruined and you'll likely be barred from borrowing more money, but you won't have to pay back your lender.

With student loans, this is not the case. You are not allowed to file for bankruptcy on your student loans. Period. This guarantees that your student debt follows you until you die. There are some cases where the paying the debt would cause undue hardship, but these options are rare.

Still, there's hope this could <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/you-may-soon-be-able-to-declare-bankruptcy-on-your-student-loans.html"> change soon.</a>

## It can narrow your career options.

If you have to take out $70,000 for education, it makes no sense to choose a career that only pays $45,000/yr like journalism, advertising, or public relations. If your education requires a significant amount of student loans, it only makes sense to follow career paths with a lot of financial upside like investment banking, management consulting, accounting, or computer science.

Of course, nothing is impossible, but this is one of those cases where your choice to educate yourself realistically gives you <i>less</i> options, not more.

## Conclusion

Don't get into debt if you can help it!
