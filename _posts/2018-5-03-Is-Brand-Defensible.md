Because of how visual contemporary culture has become (every product has a campaign, every song has a video, etc) one of the most common value propositions by new companies is their "brand. With all the talk about the importance of "tribe" and finding your "1000 true fans", combined with the ease of creating digital properties, this is not surprising. 

In most cases, brand is a UNIQUE value proposition (no two brands are alike) but it is not DEFENSIBLE. Defensibility comes with time, and that's something a lot of new brands just don't have, so I've developed a heuristic to quickly answer the question: "Is my brand defensible?"

I start with the proposition that there are at least two kinds of brands.

### "Wrap brands" vs. "Deep brands"

A "wrap" brand is a company that provides a commodity (like vitamins, sneakers, or toothbrushes) and "wraps" it in a brand, effectively adding a layer of story or association to their product. 

- "Wrap" brands: <a href="https://takecareof.com/">Care/Of</a>, <a href="https://greats.com/">GREATS</a>, <a href="https://zara.com/">ZARA</a>, <a href="https://aesop.com/">Aesop</a>

A "deep" brand is a company wherein the product (whatever it may be) is inextricably linked to the DNA of the brand. The DNA of the brand could be something like the company's history (Dior Couture), an aesthetic (Apple), or a unique perspective (Lush Cosmetics). 

- "Deep" brands: <a href="https://apple.com/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://lush.com/">Lush Cosmetics</a>, <a href="https://dior.com/">Dior Couture</a> 

###  ONLY deep brands are defensible. 

The next time you see a branded product, try this: 

1. Cover up any overt branding (logos, names, tags, environment, etc.)
2. Ask yourself, "Would someone else still know that this is brand X?"

The crux of this thought experiment has to do with piercing the veil of a company's branding efforts. Because a wrap-brand is essentially selling an commodity, when the "layer" of branding is removed (by covering/removal) the brand is instantly transformed back into a basic commodity. For any of the wrap brands mentioned above, they all fail the test above. 

Deep brands are defensible because they have differentiated themselves to the very core. Apple has developed a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-steve-jobs-love-of-simplicity-fueled-a-design-revolution-23868877/?all">signature design aesthetic</a>. Lush Cosmetics <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/story?cid=article_a-lush-legacy">revolutionized</a> the personal care category. Dior Couture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior_SE">birthed the modern licensing agreement</a>. 

### The point:

Companies like Dior, Apple, and Lush are mavericks of their own kind. While their brands did help them look, feel, and connect with their customers differently, it was their product vision and sustained innovation that etched their names in the history books. 

Brand is certainly not a second-thought for companies today, but without true aesthetic, technical, or cultural innovation at the core of your business, you won't survive long enough for your brand to matter anyways. 

Something to keep in mind.
