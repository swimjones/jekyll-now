title: Five Reasons To Burn Your Journal

I wrote in a journal every day for over four years. 

Then I decided to get rid of it. 

There's a certain freedom gained from an ability to create and destroy large amounts of high-effort work—in a totally, non-self-destructive way— and I've recognized five principal conclusions after setting fire to my own personal record. 

## Most reflections don't age well. 

A journal documents change in visceral and surprising—but not always helpful— ways. The value in an old journal is often its novelty, but the value mostly stops there. There are guaranteed to be bits and pieces of any written document that are interesting, or funny, or insightful, but it's probably true that if you agreed with it five years ago, and you agree with it now, you may not have had to question it in the first place. 

## The line between reflection and over-analysis is razor-thin. 

Too much of anything just isn't a good thing. 

Writing is a great outlet for a specific type of creative activity, but it doesn't lend itself well to working out more complex problems. Valuable ideas involving deeper reflection usually lend themselves more to a mapped approach (and usually a good walk outside), and hopefully one taking into account many, many edge cases, exceptions, and straight-up contradictions. 

But that's just one way to do things. 

## It's not very productive.

Without publishing, writing often becomes a consumptive activity more than it does a productive or generative one. It's easy to feel that writing is getting something done, but it has to be remembered that whatever the goal—clarity, productivity, or something else entirely— the journal is a mean to an end, and not the end itself.

Unless your only goal was to write in a journal, but if that were the case you probably wouldn't be reading this. 

## Writing might not be for you. 

I realized over time that writing is a great tool to express myself, but when dealing with more complicated, nonlinear ideas, it's like doing brain surgery with a spork. Writing is highly linear, and if it's the only tool in your "thinking kit" then you're at a disadvantage. 

You may even be better at working through ideas in conversation, or visually, or by actually trying your hand at it. The point is that writing is just one tool of many that you can use to work with abstractions. 

## It will reality-check your ego. 

I studied the work of Pat Steir, the American painter, and noticed that in her work, piece after piece was marked in the notation as "destroyed."

Most creative people tend to see their work as an extension of themselves, and chances are if you've written in a journal, you might think that way too. There is a very special kind of freedom in applying subtractive force to something you put your time, energy, and emotion into creating.

### So...

Try getting rid of your work. See what happens.
