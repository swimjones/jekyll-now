![Reading list!]({{"/images/bookstack.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Of the best books I have ever read, approximately zero were discovered through academic curricula or classroom bookshelves. I always wondered why this was the case, and it quickly became clear:

The books you read in a classroom more often than not promote the agenda of the educational institution. Once you ask yourself, "What's missing?" and "How do I find it?" you can expose yourself to a world of different ideas.

Here are six books to start your journey.

## <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140280197/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140280197&linkCode=as2&tag=swimjones-20&linkId=1f621485663a32f5a383438e44bf83e3">The 48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</a>

This is one of the few books I've read that I would truly consider a weapon. Greene's 48 Laws is a treatise on power, influence, and the political games that have shaped human history. Within it are more than a few morally-questionable directives. For example:

- Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.
- Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.
- Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker— seem dumber than your mark.

Depending on how you approach this book— exposé, warning, or "how-to guide"— your outlook on social situations and what it means to be an individual will certainly undergo a shift.

### Why it's not in a classroom?

This is not a book that will create docile, obedient students.

## <a href="http://wallstreetplayboys.com/efficiency/">Efficiency: How To Get Rich Without Giving Up Your Life</a>

A clear, lucid guide by former Wall-Streeters to achieving the life you want, all while dispelling the myths, fluff, and faux-motivational speeches that pervade most business and personal finance books.

If you're feeling at all lost or as if you don't know what you're supposed to be doing, this is a great read to get your head on straight and start focusing on your most valuable resource— your time.

### Why it's not in a classroom?

The aspirational goals of education as a romantic tool for self-discovery are noticeably absent.

## <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkCode=as2&tag=swimjones-20&linkId=f01ca505949e72c9829f19198def37e0">Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder - Nassim Taleb</a>

Antifragile details a theoretical framework for taking advantage of stress, uncertainty, and disorder. Witty and scathing observations cover a variety of topics in risk, probability, and what it means to make an intelligent decision.

This text is also a great introduction to ideas like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy effect</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology">teleology</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">Black Swan events.</a>

### Why it's not in a classroom?

Antifragile actively and effectively criticizes the most esteemed members of our society— doctors, economists, and politicans.

## <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476731713/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1476731713&linkCode=as2&tag=swimjones-20&linkId=8e938f3adbee526733f160c9f201cc2f">Finite and Infinite Games - James P. Carse</a>

Even reading the first page of this book is enough to warp your perspective. The distinction between the two types of games— finite (played to win) and infinite (played for the sake of playing)— is a conceptual framework few get the privilege of learning.

This is one of those books where you have to ask "Where is this even coming from?"

A great trip.

### Why it's not in a classroom?

Too abstract for most structured discussions.

## <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612680194/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1612680194&linkCode=as2&tag=swimjones-20&linkId=a05f326d78e38cdad0db3bc5e24d7d20">Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki</a>

A classic book on money that redefines what can be termed an asset and a liability. Kiyosaki's perspective on wealth, education, and the benefits of financial freedom are a must read at any stage of personal development.

### Why isn't it in a classroom?

Education creates employees, and this book stresses the value of entrepreneurship.
