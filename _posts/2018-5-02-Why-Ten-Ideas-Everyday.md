I've written between ten and twenty business ideas per day for the last forty days. There are a lot of benefits to this kind of constant practice, but here I'll mention a few that stand out. 

### To practice disciplined creativity.

I used to think that creative moments were like being struck by lighting— as if for some reason the stars aligned and some divine inspiration suddenly became clear. After around two-hundred ideas, I realized there is an "idea reserve" that we all tend to pull from, a framework or concept that we repackage and reinvent as "new" ideas.

 After that point, creativity—by necessity— becomes a more disciplined process. Ideas must be sought out and played with, and this leads often leads to surprising discoveries. 

### To see what I pay attention to. 

I didn't realize I was so interested in healthcare. Once I read through some past ideas, though, I realized that nearly forty percent of my ideas had some connection to aging, longevity, or cosmetic improvements. The rest are usually a combination of software, customer service, and deep branding. 

Once you start generating ideas more freely, you'll likely notice there are things you didn't realize you were paying attention to. Becoming aware of what your subconscious is retaining is a powerful advantage. 

### To find my creative blind spots. 

I am obsessed with delightful customer experiences. Most of the pain points I recognize in my ideas have to do with certain inefficencies or inadequacies in the customer experience— questions like, "Whose story isn't being told?" and "What could we show people to take them somewhere new?"

The flip side of that is realizing what I don't pay as much attention to, in this case back-office functions and logistical details, which is eye-opening in considering what kind of business partners would be best in the future. 

### A few favorites...
1. An e-commerce site for kids that runs on smart contracts set up by the parents. Read for thirty minutes, and unlock a credit to purchase something. 
2. A privatized prison system for low-risk offenders that uses local, small-scale agriculture as a revenue generator, rehabilitation curriculum, and engine to promote healthy eating. 
3. Biodegradable shotgun shells and munitions casings. 
4. Artwork valuation algorithm— estimate a value based on historical prices, current/past ownership, location, association with movements.
