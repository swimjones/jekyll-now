We will never regain our youth— and that's scary for some people to think about. 

Based on high-correlation trends and rapid growth in beauty (skincare, cosmetics), wellness (diet, fitness), and personal care (supplements, spiritual retreats), I argue that consumer health represents one of the more impactful business opportunities in our lifetime. 

I foresee a convergence between these different verticals, and the birth of a super-category—and super-company— driving the boom in holistic living. This is driven by a few simple observations: 

## 🏙 The future is urban. 

If you've ever spent time in a dense, urban environment like Hong Kong, Tokyo, or New York, you will have an intimate understanding of the see-and-be-seen "sidewalk culture" that exists there. 

The results of a high population density combined with high income fosters an appearance-driven culture perfect for fashion, beauty, and health companies. It's no surprise that the top fashion cities (New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo) exhibit their own sidewalk-cultures, while less dense cities (Los Angeles, Berlin) have had trouble establishing their own. 

Exceptions include Dhaka, Bangladesh (45,000) [high unemployment, high poverty] and Paris (2,600) [historic center of fashion]. 

- Population Density of "Fashion Cities" (sq. kilometers)
	- New York: 11,000 ✅
	- Hong Kong: 6,987 ✅
	- Tokyo: 6,158 ✅
	- London: 4,542 ✅
	- Los Angeles: 2,910 🚫
	- Berlin: 3,944 🚫

Plus, when is the last time you talked to a young person who said they wanted to live somewhere that <i>wasn't</i> a major urban area? Rural cities have resorted to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-bad-is-the-labor-shortage-cities-will-pay-you-to-move-there-1525102030">paying people to move there</a>. 


Urbanization breeds an appearance-driven culture, and understanding that our health is highly correlated with our appearance, preserving it becomes an imperative. 

## 👀 Our culture is hyper-visual.  

In the first four months of 2017, Instagram added 100M users. Let that sink in. 

We now live in an always-on culture. Brands and people alike are expected to be available around the clock— and pumping out content just as often. Take a look at any major fashion or beauty company, and try to find a time when their Instagram story isn't updated.  

The luxury business is an attention game now, and nothing captures our attention better than beautiful, young faces— likely why skincare was the <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/9-trends-defining-the-beauty-revolution">second-fastest-growing industry in the US for 2017.</a> 

Our face is our second sales-pitch (after our social profiles), and anything we can do to preserve or improve it will see wide adoption in the future. 

## 👶🏼‍ We are obsessed with youth. 

I can't tell you how many people I've met whose goal is to make the Forbes 30-under-30 list. Millenials and Gen-Z today are fed stories of people making their mark on the world and achieving fame and glory before the ripe, old age of 25.

One of the key marks of youth is good health, and if the explosion of <a href="https://www.ota.com/resources/market-analysis">organic foods</a> and <a href="https://www.spynergyconsulting.com/boutiqe-fitness-industry-statistics/">boutique fitness</a> is any indicator, health, and with it the preservation of youth, is a high priority for my generation. 


## 🙇🏼‍ It's in our control. 

Our health is one of the few things that is within our control. In times where everything from geopolitics, to the environment, to the privacy of our own data feels out of our control, our own physical, mental, and spiritual health sets itself apart as something we can control. 

When people are in control of their health, it's an empowering feeling, and if there's any way that people want to feel right now, it's empowered. 

## In conclusion... 

We are going to the see the birth of an empire in health. The enterprise that can capitalize on these trends and build out a logical next-step for the health-conscious consumer will be a big winner. 

People can handle not having the newest sneakers. People are fine wearing <a href="https://www.grailed.com/">someone else's clothing</a>, or <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">secondhand leather goods</a>. But you would be hard-pressed to find anyone that would give up their health— for anything.

With the fast-approaching nexus in beauty, wellness, and personal care, there is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs and established companies alike. 

Why not take advantage?
