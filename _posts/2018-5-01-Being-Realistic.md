I meet a lot of entrepreneurs, and I can say with confidence that most come off as a little bit delusional. It's not wrong— in fact, I think it's required in any honest attempt at something groundbreaking. 

Still, I have a lot of problems with people (mostly those WITHOUT any skin in the game) talking about the need to be "realistic."

I do not support this in the slightest. 

A recommendation to "be realistic" is not the altrustic savior-talk that it sounds like. More often than not, it's someone offloading their own limiting beliefs onto someone else. 

I mean, let's be real, it's not like the person is saying they want to become a dolphin (in which case, they DEFINITELY need to be realistic), but more that they want to attempt something in spite of the status quo. 

I believe that a clear, practical optimism is the healthy alternative to "being realistic". Everyone should have a healthy relationship with reality, being able to understand risks and above all just be sensible. Even people who preach the Jobs-esque "reality distortion field" still know that the next Apple won't be built in a day.  

This kind of pragmatic hopefulness is about having your head above water— being able to clearly articulate the possibility you imagine while still acknowledging the implied risk (and dealing with the laws of physics).

Case in point? You can be optimistic and not have people thinking you need your head checked. Get out there, cultivate a healthy relationship with reality, and cut off everyone who says to "be realistic."
