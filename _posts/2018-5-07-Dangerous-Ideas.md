Life is a game of evening the odds.

From our youth most of us are conditioned with ideas and feedback loops that stifle creativity, snuff out ambition, and make us fear the unknown. Without proper <a href="https://nalukai.org/">intervention</a>, we are conditioned to jump through hoops, disregard common sense, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveodland/2012/03/24/college-costs-are-soaring/#6e638e3d1f86">indulge on overpriced credentials</a> to avoid falling through the widening cracks in our society.

But I don't accept those terms, and you don't have to either, so I keep four central ideas in mind:

## Everything is conditional.

- "X company only recruits juniors and seniors."
- "You have to know X and do Y before you can even try Z."
- "It's just not possible. Barely anyone does X without Y."

Nothing interesting comes from following the rules. The most compelling scenarios and the greatest stories we tell are born from edge cases, anomalies, and unexpected events— the exceptions to the rule.

So be an anomaly.

Every rule can be broken, every agreement negotiated, and every "truth" challenged. Knowing this allows you a degree of freedom unavailable to most. With this in mind, every obstacle IS the opportunity.

## You don't have to be an expert.

Kevin Systrom always says "You don't have to know everything. You just need to be <i>dangerous</i>."

If you don't know Kevin Systrom is, check your phone. You probably use his app.

The reality is that we live in a technocracy (society influenced by elite class of technical experts), and the kind of imposter syndrome it ingrains convinces people they can't make a difference unless they're a credentialed expert in the field. I know people who, for that very fear of failure, are too afraid to just <i>try something new</i>—people who can't imagine doing something new without acquiring a degree or certification for it first.

I fully support developing a strong theoretical background (especially in professional contexts), but the idea that you need PhD-level knowledge to make a material impact is backwards and totally antiquated.

## Life is a single-player game.

Everyone expects something of you, whether they express it directly or not. Predicting behavior, creating fictions, and making assumptions is in our nature. It's <a href="http://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/grad_cog/ancestral%20landscapes/sapiens%20book.pdf">the reason we're so successful</a>.

When you start changing and straying from the assumptions people have of you, you will experience significant friction. If you haven't, it's because you are doing <i>exactly what people expect of you</i>.

At some point, you realize that life—as many people as there are that seem to be involved—is a single-player game. We didn't come into it alone, but we'll experience a great deal of it by ourselves. You want to make sure that when you look in the mirror, you can be proud of the person looking back at you.

And that might mean making some tough decisions.

## Everything that happens to you is good.

When you want something bad enough, everything becomes an advantage. Whether things are challenging or easy, simple or complex, transcendent or mundane, as long as you can <a href="http://wtf.tw/ref/carse.pdf">keep playing the game</a>, nothing "bad" can happen.

Some things in life will be tough, or boring, or soul-crushingly bureaucratic, but if you can wrap your head around this idea—that any opportunity to keep moving forward is a good one— you will open yourself up to a world of possibility and find the advantage in every moment, even the "bad" ones.

Because the point isn't always to win. Sometimes the goal is just to <i>keep the play going</i>.
