I am a student, writer, self-taught developer, and entrepreneur. I use this site to share observations, insights, and ideas.

I am currently developing a suite of consumer health products, and also work as a fashion industry advisor to MUKISAâ€” an Africa-inspired leather goods brand.

In the past I have started and operated a clothing line, event series, and blog.

I aspire to build a portfolio of groundbreaking consumer brands in health, fashion, and technology.

### Keep in touch.
