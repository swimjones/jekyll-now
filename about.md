I am a global student with extensive knowlege of the global fashion industry. 

I am currently developing a suite of consumer health products, and also work as a fashion industry advisor to MUKISAâ€” an Africa-inspired leather goods brand. 

I plan on entering investment banking and aspire to build a portfolio of groundbreaking consumer brands in health, fashion, and technology.

### Keep in touch.
